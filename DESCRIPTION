Description: An automated machine learning algorithm (AutoML) is designed to 
             create homogeneous or heterogeneous stacked ensemble models from 
             the given base-learners. In doing so, different criteria are used 
             to identify the best models, which increase the diversity among the 
             selected models, leading to stronger stacked ensemble models. next, 
             the model is optimized for a combination of diverse models, gradually
             increasing in including number of top-performing models. Currently, only 
             'h2o.ai' models are supported.
